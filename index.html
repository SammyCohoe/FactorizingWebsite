            <h3> A Brief History of Prime Numbers and Division</h3>
                <p>
                    The earliest evidence of mathematics in our human history takes place in Southern Africa from 70,000-10,000 BC where there was evidence of counting and geometrical patterns.
                    The oldest known records of multiplication and division come from Old Babylonian Mathematics dated back to 2,000-1,000 BC.
                    We known this because there are clay tablets which have been found that cover many different topics in mathematics such as algebra, fractions, multiplication and division, as well as trigonometry and quadratic equations.
                    Around the same time in Ancient Egypt (2,000 - 1,650 BC) comes the first recorded records of prime numbers, written on the Rhind papyrus which is a famous Egyptian mathematical text also including area formulas, arithmetic, geometry, and perfect number theory.
